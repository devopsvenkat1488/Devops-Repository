In today's fast-paced tech environment, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become a crucial practice for managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. Harness, a powerful continuous delivery platform, simplifies this process, allowing you to automate the deployment of your infrastructure. In this blog, I'll walk you through the steps I took to successfully create AWS infrastructure using Harness.

### Why Choose Harness for IaC?

Harness provides a user-friendly interface and robust features that make it easier to manage your infrastructure. With its seamless integration capabilities, you can automate deployments, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across your environments.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A Harness account
    
* AWS account credentials
    
* Basic understanding of AWS services and IaC concepts
    

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Harness Environment

1. **Log in to Harness**: Start by logging into your Harness account. If you don't have one, you can sign up on their website.
    
2. **Create a New Project**: Navigate to the Projects section and create a new project for your AWS infrastructure.
    
3. **Connect to AWS**: In the project settings, add your AWS account credentials. This will allow Harness to interact with your AWS environment.
    

### Step 2: Define Your Infrastructure as Code

1. **Create a New Infrastructure Definition**: Go to the Infrastructure section and create a new definition. Choose AWS as your cloud provider.
    
2. **Specify Resources**: Define the AWS resources you need, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, or RDS databases. Use YAML or JSON to specify the configurations.

3. **Version Control**: Store your infrastructure code in a version control system like Git. This ensures you can track changes and collaborate with your team.

### Step 3: Deploy Your Infrastructure

1. **Create a Pipeline**: Set up a deployment pipeline in Harness. This pipeline will automate the process of provisioning your AWS resources.

    **Add Stages**: Define stages in your pipeline, such as provisioning, testing, and deployment. Each stage can have multiple steps to execute specific tasks.

3. **Run the Pipeline**: Execute the pipeline to deploy your infrastructure. Harness will automatically provision the resources as defined in your code.

### Step 4: Monitor and Manage

1. **Monitor Deployments**: Use Harness's monitoring tools to track the status of your deployments. This helps in identifying any issues early on.
    
2. **Manage Changes**: As your infrastructure evolves, update your code and rerun the pipeline to apply changes. Harness ensures that your infrastructure remains consistent with your code.
    

### Conclusion

Using Harness for Infrastructure as Code streamlines the process of managing AWS resources. By automating deployments, you can focus on building and scaling your applications without worrying about manual infrastructure management.
