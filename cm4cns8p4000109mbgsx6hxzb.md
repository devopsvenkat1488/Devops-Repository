## **An Inspirational Example**

Imagine a company struggling with manual deployments that cause frequent delays and errors. By adopting DevOps practices, they:

1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline: Developers push code to GitHub, and Jenkins automates testing and deployment.

3. Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and resilience.
    

The result? Faster delivery, fewer bugs, and happier teams and customers.
